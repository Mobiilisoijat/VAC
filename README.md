# Vaka-varma (VAC)

Vaka-varma (VAC) is our library-access guard service. Using our KirjastoK채nnykk채 application the user may enter through a library gate operated by VAC. 

VAC uses a QR-code generated in KirjastoK채nnykk채 application for every registered user. 
This could be used in the future for denying access to certain users or perhaps gathering data on how many visitors a certain library gets.
